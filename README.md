#Animation

Let's prototype a loading screen.

1. When the user presses the button labeled "Load Something", open the modal by fading it in using jquery
2. Add the property to the .loading element that will animate it's properties over a duration of 2 seconds.
3. Write a class called "spin" that can be applied to the .loading element to spin it in a full circle (360 degrees)
4. Write a keyframe animation called "SPIN" that will accomplish the same task as /#3 above.
5. Apply the animation to the .loading object so that it runs infinitely.
